> Inigo could have been talking about access to justice, a term so frequently cited for so many things that it is no longer clear what it means. In this course we will explore the meaning of access to justice by attempting to define terms, quantify the scope of the problem, and above all, question assumptions about the access-to-justice gap. Assignments will include assigned reading and independent research to fuel class discussions.
