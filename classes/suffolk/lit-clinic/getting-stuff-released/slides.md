You've got six weeks until your mini projects must be ready to launch, but that includes Thanksgiving break and finals.

It's not as much time as it may seem.

So what does it mean for it to be ready to launch? We're going to talk about that today, and also …

By now you should have started your big project, too. You've got more time, but you've got a **lot** more work to do—not to mention your mini project.

So you need a plan, but in order to plan, you've got to know what you're going to build.

And if you think about it, if you have clarity about what you're building, it should be easier to know when you're done/ready to launch.

???
**What do you need to know in order to answer these questions for your projects?**

We need a definition of done. In design and development, you should have a list of requirements—what's **required** of the finished product.

That's what an MVP is. So we'll start there.

The faces in this image represent the customer—the person we're building our tools for. In this case, our customer wants us to build a car.

**Why do you think the top row is labeled "not like this"?**

- None of the first 3 iterations are testable, so we can't learn anything from them
- As a result, the car we've delivered is probably full of issues

**What is different about the bottom row?**

- Each iteration is testable so we can learn from it
- Each iteration improves on the previous one based on the customer's feedback
- The end result is slightly different and the customer is thrilled, not just happy

**But what might be wrong with the bottom row?**

- The customer isn't happy with the early iterations
- With hardware, this would involve a lot of work that isn't building a car (but what about with software?)

## Which is the actual MVP?

**How would you decide which iteration is both minimal and viable?**

It's going to depend on the customer's requirements.

**Who is the customer for your projects?**

- Quinten and David
- The public
- The court or legal aid organization we're working with

We will continue to use "MVP," but what we mean by it is more like **earliest useful product**.

Since we've already done this a few times, we already have a set of possible definitions: the legal app maturity model.

## The [legal app maturity model](https://projects.suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/legal-tech-overview/maturity-model/)

???
The legal app maturity model:
- Is a menu of possible MVP definitions for online guided interviews
- Describes the earliest online guided interviews we're willing to release

**From the [quick summary](https://projects.suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/legal-tech-overview/maturity-model/#quick-summary), what's the benefit of level 1 over a plain PDF or DOCX form?**

**What about level 1.5? Level 2?**

We're aiming for level 2, FYI.

That's what a level 2 interview should feel like. For details, see the [sample MVP requirements](https://assemblyline.suffolklitlab.org/docs/get_started/project_management#requirements) on the **Project management** page of the Document Assembly Line website.

We've gone over all this because these projects aren't just for a grade. People with few other options for legal help must be able to rely on them!

When we come back, we'll switch gears and talk about planning your big project.

## How to plan your big project

???
For your big project, we're going to introduce a new tool: a project board.

---
## GitHub project board basics

- Cards == issues (but can be drafts)
- Move cards from left to right
- Cards can have checklists and resources
- Create a project board for your team
- Add the **LIT Clinic current students** team
- Connect your repo (when it's ready)
- Convert draft issues to issues

## Set up your project board

???
1. Duplicate the template to create a project board for your team
2. Add the **LIT Clinic current students** team
3. Connect your repo (if it's ready) and convert draft cards to issues
4. Update the project board so it accurately represents the status of your project
