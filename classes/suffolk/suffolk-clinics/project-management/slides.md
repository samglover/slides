# Project management<br>.color-suffolk-gold[ v. ]<br>Time management<br>.color-suffolk-blue-dim[(work planning)]

???
Today we'll be talking about project management. Project management is about planning all the steps in your project, from beginning to end. You may be planning for a team, or just for yourself, but our central focus for project management is the project itself, and the time frame is now until the project is complete.

Next week, we'll talk about time management and work planning. Work planning is about figuring what *you* should be focused on from day-to-day across all your projects, and the time frame is usually one week at a time.

One more thing before we start: project management and work planning aren't just about task lists and calendars. That's the easy part.

The hard part is actually doing the work. Everyone finds it hard to get organized, focus, and be productive sometimes, and some of us have additional challenges.

So:

1. **Take care of yourself.** Everyone needs to eat healthy, exercise, and get plenty of sleep!
2. **Take care of your brain.** If you struggle with executive function (like I do, due to my ADHD), please talk to your doctor. I can't tell you what's going on with your brain, but if you know your brain is neurodivergent or suspect it might be, don't ignore it! Get help! Like my doctor told me when I was hesitant to take medication for my ADHD, "you can't think your way out of a chemical imbalance in your brain."

  It can make a huge difference.

# How to plan a project

.circled-numbers[
1. Identify the ultimate **goal**
2. Clarify **deliverables**
3. Identify **milestones**
4. Identify, scope, and assign **tasks**
5. Create a project **timeline**
6. Schedule **check-ins**

I'm not going to talk too much about tools in this session. 

If you are working in a regular clinic, all of this information is attorney work product, so you should use secure tools like Clio notes and tasks.

In the LIT Clinic, we use GitHub project boards.

I'll suggest some work plannnig tools next week, but always keep confidentiality in mind.

# Identify the ultimate goal

???
You should always keep the ultimate, big-picture goal in mind. It is the context for all the rest, and will affect the decisions you make.

For example, if your client just wants money, you might make different decisions than if they want to stay in their home or job.

# Clarify deliverables and requirements

???
"Deliverables" means what you are currently working on: a brief, a contract, a hearing, etc.

You might have only one, but you'll often have two or three. For example, a hearing often involves filing a brief, maybe a reply, and arguing in court.

Make sure to list anything required for the deliverable to be considered complete. For example, a brief must be filed and served on all parties. Contracts must be fully executed.

# Identify milestones

???
Milestones are the major steps on the way to the deliverable, like drafts and revisions, initial briefs and replies, etc. They should have their own deadlines, which will shape the project timeline. For example, if you know it will take your professor a week to review a draft social security appeal, you'll need to put a deadline on it that gives you at least that much time.

# Identify, scope, and assign tasks

???
Now, for each milestone, list all the tasks and sub-tasks involved.

Use the "in order to X, I'll need to Y" framework from the handout. Then, take the time to scope each task.

Scoping tasks means clarifying what the task or project is and estimating the time required to do it.

- Make the title actionable—a complete sentence that describes the work to be done
- Add sub-tasks (also with actionable titles) for each step necessary to complete the primary task
- Add any notes, links, and attachments that will help you get the task done
- Add a size/time estimate for the task or project

When it comes to estimating the size of a task or project, I use “T-shirt sizes.” Here are the rough time equivalents to T-shirt sizes as I think of them:

- XS = less than 1 hour
- SM = 1–4 hours (half a day or less)
- MD = 4–8 hours (1 day or less)
- LG = 8 hours to 1 week
- XL = more than 1 week

# Create a project timeline

???
Arrange your deliverables and milestones on a calendar between now and your deliverable(s) deadline(s). Your task time estimates should help you figure out if you have given yourself enough time.

# Schedule regular check-ins

???
Whether or not you have a team, schedule a regular, weekly project check-in. This can be brief, just a chance to review/share:

1. What you did since the last check-in
2. If any "blockers" are preventing you from making progress
3. What you are planning to work on over the next week

(You are probably already doing this—or something very similar—in your clinic, so good job!)

I'm sure you all have a current project. Does anyone want to share their project so we can start working on it as a group?
