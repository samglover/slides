# Managing Ongoing Projects in a Legal Tech Clinic

.font-size-md.suffolk-gold[[Sam Glover](https://samglover.net)]

???
Description:

> Some clinic projects fit neatly into a semester or year; others have longer timelines, so that multiple students will come and go over the project’s lifetime. Join us to discuss tools and best practices for managing complex, ambitious, ongoing projects in a clinical setting.

# Sam Glover

Solo practice &rarr; Lawyerist &rarr; LIT Lab &rarr; Midwest Clinical Conference

???
* I started a solo practice where I sued abusive debt collectors
* Then I started Lawyerist
* Then I joined Suffolk University Law School's Legal Innovation and Technology Lab—the LIT Lab—to scale its Document Assembly Line project. As part of that I also work on ongoing clinic projects with law students in the LIT Clinic.
* Then Emily Buccholz, the Law & Entrepreneurship Clinic director here at UW Madison, who I'm lucky enough to have worked with when she was a law student and I was teaching appellate advocacy at the University of Minnesota Law School, reached out to catch up and ivite me to this conference
* So here I am

# Caveat

.font-size-md.suffolk-gold[The LIT Clinic's ongoing projects are a work in progress]

???
* I'm here to share and learn, not because I think we have the magic formula for big, ambitious, ongoing clinic projects.
* Our clinic projects are very much a work in progress. As David Colarusso likes to say, we're building the bike while we ride it.
* But so far the bike seems to be getting us where we want to go.

I've deliberately only prepared 30 minutes of slides, so please ask questions or share your own experiences with ongoing projects at any time.

# Why do ongoing<br>legal tech projects?

--
count: false

* Solve real legal problems for **lots** of real people
* Partners like courts and orgs need ongoing solutions
* Develop reusable pedagogical tools

???
At Suffolk we think of our law clinics as a law firm within the law school. Obviously, students in those clinics work with real-world clients with real-world legal problems like criminal prosecution and defense, business, immigration, family law, Innocence Project, etc.

Similarly, our legal tech clinic, the LIT Clinic, is a research & development consultancy to courts and legal aid organizations, while our LIT Fellows serve their home clinic. We have teams of students who are working on self-help tools for several courts, as well as research, data analysis, and tools for their home clinics.

In order to work on real-world projects, you have to work with real-world timelines. And for legal tech projects that often means long-term commitments to the project. We have to keep the servers online, for one thing. But we also have to update the tools we build when the law changes, when the technology updates, etc.

Many projects undertaken by law school clinics and labs are tied to the semester or year, or to grant funding. When students go home for summer break or the grant is spent, the project dies. Courts can't afford to do that. Neither can the people who need the tools. The guided interviews our students work on are intended to be used by thousands of people for whom much is often at stake. The interviews often take more than a single academic year to build and they must be updated as laws, forms, and technology change. The Document Assembly Line must be sustainable in order for courts and legal aid organizations to rely on it. If we can't reassure our partners that the Document Assembly Line will serve their needs for years to come—beyond the life of any academic year or grant—they won't feel confident enough to rely on it. And if they don't rely on it, we will lose out on a truly unique opportunity for Suffolk Law students, who get to work on real-world legal technology projects that help real people, hand-in-hand with courts and orgs, and see those access-to-justice tools used for years to come!

The courts only work with us because we make a long-term commitment to the project.

# What makes an ongoing<br>legal tech project different?

.font-size-xl.suffolk-gold[Handoffs]

???
* This isn't unique to legal tech projects, obviously. 
* But the timelines for our projects tend to be longer than the timelines for a criminal prosecution, civil lawsuit, or business formation. 
* Our timelines are effectively indefinite.

* Microsoft Teams
* Video meetings (Zoom)
* GitHub
* Documentation website + AI tools<br>([assemblyline.suffolklitlab.org](https://assemblyline.suffolklitlab.org))

???
* **Microsoft Teams.** We have a separate channel for each project, for general communication and project file storage.
* **Video meetings (Zoom).** For project meetings among students and with partners.
* **GitHub.** Code version control (repos), issues, workflow, and project boards.
* **Documentation website.** Procedures, resources, etc.<br>(plus we're experimenting with AI tools so students can ask questions of the documentation, not just read it).

# Challenges

--
count: false

* Sustainability (money)
* Handoffs
* Scoping
* Updates/maintenance

???
* **Sustainability.** How will you keep the project funded over the long haul? We use tools the University already pays for (Teams and Zoom), free tools (GitHub, Docassemble), or tools we built ourselves (the Document Assembly Line), so the out-of-pocket cost is minimal. And the larger project strategy is to get courts to support the Document Assembly Line, which will enable us to continue offering these tools to our students.
* **Handoffs.** Documentation and preservation are key to reducing the time it takes to get a new student or team up and running.
* **Scoping.** Making sure each cohort of students has an interesting part of the project to work on is also important.

# Share your experience with ongoing projects

???
I'm here to share, but I'm even more interesting in talking with folks who are trying to do big, ambitious, ongoing projects in a Lab or clinic, or who have tried and succeeded or failed.

One of the challenges with ongoing legal tech projects is getting access to tools.

Well, the Document Assembly Line is free and open source, well documented, and we've found it to be relatively easy for students to learn and apply over the course of a school year.

If you'd like to use it for your legal tech clinic, we'd love to help you get up and running.
