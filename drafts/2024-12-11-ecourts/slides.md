Description:

> Ever wish you could benefit from the work other courts have put into customizing their systems? Or wish you could work with courts to build a system tailored to your needs? Well, you can.
> 
> As courts seek to expand access to justice, some are doing it in an open, sustainable way with open-source software and non-profit collaborations. Attendees will take away an understanding of 1) Digital public infrastructure and how it impacts software procurement, 2) The pros and cons of open-source software and how courts can use it, especially for access-to-justice projects, 3) How courts can leverage non-profit partnerships, 4) How to avoid RFPs that exclude open-source software and non-profit partnerships, and 5) Current open-source, access-to-justice projects courts should be aware of.
