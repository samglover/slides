For context, let's look at where we are in the school year …

# You have .circle[~3] weeks of the fall semester left

???
Not counting Thanksgiving

# Let's organize those into<br>2-week sprints

.circled-numbers[
1. **October 28–November 10**<br>Ends this week
2. **November 11–24**
3. **November 25–December 3** (~1 week)<br>Includes Thanksgiving break

* Sprints create smaller chunks of progress
* Also useful for planning out your project
* At the end of a sprint you should be able to demonstrate what you did
* Why 2 weeks?
  * 1 week just isn't long enough to make meaningful progress
  * But 3 weeks is too long to go without checking in

# You will have .circle[7] sprints in the spring

???
FYI

---
<i class="bi bi-image circled font-size-xxl"></i>

# Start with the big picture

* Identify your **deadlines**
* Note any smaller deadlines along the way
* Identify what is expected on each deadline
* Add **everything** to the project that you currently know you need to do

???
You can't plan if you don't know what you are planning!

Give examples from existing student projects.

# Plan your sprints

1. Scope and prioritize the backlog
2. Move **only** the next sprint's tasks to the **To do** column
3. Do the work
4. Demonstrate what you did
5. Repeat

???
I'll move to a project board in a minute and demonstrate this.

## Scoping

Clarify what each task is and estimate the time required to do it

* Make the title actionable—a complete sentence that describes the work to be done
* Add sub-tasks (also with actionable titles)
* Add notes, links, and attachments
* Add a time estimate

### Try T-shirt sizes for time estimates

.table-ify[
* Size
  * XL
  * LG
  * MD
  * SM
  * XS
* Estimate
  * more than 1 week
  * 8 hours to 1 week
  * 4–8 hours (1 day or less)
  * 1–4 hours (half a day or less)
  * less than 1 hour

# Prioritizing

Don’t get hung up on this. Just get close.

<i class="bi bi-image circled font-size-xxl"></i>

# How does it look?

???
Consider:

* How much time you have between now and the deadline
* How much work you think you have between now and the deadline

Now you should have an idea whether you can actually get this project done by the **big deadline**. If not, address it **immediately**.

The longer you wait, the harder it is to have that conversation.

---

<i class="bi bi-card-heading circled font-size-xxl"></i>

# Populate the To do list

* Pull cards from the top of the Backlog
* Pull **only** the cards you intend to work on during the next sprint

???
If you know the next deadline, figure out about how many cards (accounting for size) you'll need to do for each sprint leading up to the deadline.

Your goal is to put a realistic amount of work in the **To do** column.

---

<i class="bi bi-kanban-fill circled font-size-xxl"></i>

# Get to work!

* Move cards to **Doing** when you start working on them
* Move cards back to **Blocked/waiting** if you get stuck or need someone else to do something (cards with the **question** label often go here)
* Move cards to **Done** when you finish the task!

???
Moving cards to **Doing** and **Blocked/waiting** helps you pick up where you left off.
