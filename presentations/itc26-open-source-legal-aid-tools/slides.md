**Introductions**
- Who you are
- What you do
- Your experience with open-source software
- One thing that's not work-related that you'd love to talk about at receptions, affinity dinners, etc.

Session description, FYI:

> Open-source tools have the potential to reshape access to justice innovation with scalable, cost-effective tools. In this presentation we will look at real-word examples of open-source legal aid tools and explore the advantages and challenges of open-source solutions, including transparency, customizability, vendor independence, security, sustainability, and community. We will also compare open-source software and development with traditional software and help you decide whether to prefer or require open-source licenses in your technology projects.

## Why use open-source software?

???
**Q &rarr; Jessica: What is open-source and why are we talking about it?**

- Don't think of open source as free (no cost)
- But it is usually less expensive over time
- What it's free from is vendor lock-in
- Can avoid duplicating effort and leverage other open-source projects (like LACI + CourtListener)
- But you'll still have to pay service costs. **Infrastructure costs money.**

## Open-source challenges

???
**Q -> Alison: What are the challenges of open-source tools?**

- You have to know more about them up front. It’s harder to say yes to than a well-established commercial product.
- If there isn’t a community, you’re kind of on your own for support. (Although you might be on your own with a commercial product, too.)
- Momentum

???
**Q -> Luigi: Why did you choose to release LACI as an open-source tool?**

- Spread development costs around
- Leverage community

## Community

???
**Q -> Jessica and Luigi: Community is definitely key. What goes into building and fostering one?**

- Give ownership
- Make it easy to join/contribute
- "Pop the bubble"—get outside of the A2J space to bring more people to the table
- Funders are part of the community

## Evaluating open-source tools

???
**Q -> Alison: How should we evaluate open-source tools?**

- Be nosy
- Ask who it is maintained by, and how
- Evaluate long-term costs, not just up-front costs
- Is there an engaged community?
- Does the project have funders? Who?

## RFP language

???
**Q -> Alison and Luigi: What key language should we include in an RFP if we want to use or build open-source tools?**

- Two possibilities:
	- Use existing open-source tools to accomplish a goal
	- Build something that will be released with an open-source license
- Check your standard service contract to make sure it has an open-source option (or requirement)
- Open-source probably shouldn't be the deciding factor. There isn't always a good open-source option.
- But when nothing meets your current need, build something—and release it as open source

## Closing thoughts

???
**Q -> all: Is there anything you didn't get to say that you wanted to?**

**Q -> all: What's your ask (small or big) for this audience?**
