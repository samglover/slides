Description:

> Guided interviews help self-represented litigants successfully assemble complex court forms. Connecting those interviews to e-filing helps SRLs navigate courts’ complex filing and service procedures, too. Together, they help make courts more accessible to everyone. In this session, you will learn how courts, legal aid organizations, and academic institutions are partnering to efficiently and effectively connect guided interviews to court dockets. Panelists from Illinois courts and legal aid will discuss the development of user-friendly e-filing systems, including integrated document assembly, SRL-specific e-filing interfaces, customer support, and more, using free resources, tools, and software developed by the Suffolk Legal Innovation & Technology Lab and being developed by the Free Law Project.
